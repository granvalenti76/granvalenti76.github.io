description: Reflections on living with ADHD diagnosed in adulthood
---

In recent years, I've introduced radical changes into my life. Periodically, I feel the need to delve into new topics, to experiment and fully understand what captures my attention at any given moment. Today I know that this behavior is typical of those living with ADHD.

The diagnosis came late, in adulthood, but it finally gave a name to something I had always perceived as part of me. With the help of my doctor, I'm learning to manage the condition with greater awareness and serenity.

For over twenty years I've worked as a character artist, but my interests have always been multiple. Recently, I've dedicated myself to learning Unreal Engine, Godot, animation in Blender, and some scripting with artificial intelligence. This month, for example, I decided to subscribe to Claude Code, intrigued by the numerous positive reviews.

## The Switch to macOS

A month ago I purchased a brand new MacBook Air M4 with 16 GB. After years of working on Windows and numerous experiments with Linux — which gave me great satisfaction for some self-hosted projects like Mastodon and PixelFed — I felt the need to simplify.

I no longer want to spend hours searching for documentation to make every single thing work. Today I simply want a stable POSIX/Unix system with a well-designed and coherent graphical interface. The choice fell on Apple for practical rather than ideological reasons.

I still keep a desktop with Fedora and GNOME, but I use it less and less.

During the month I thoroughly explored macOS Sequoia. I tried Apple Intelligence (still limited, but with interesting writing tools) and Shortcuts. Blender and ZBrush work perfectly. I tested CrossOver with some Steam games — the MetalFX graphics library rendering is quite impressive — and installed Godot to experiment with my characters.

## Discovering Claude

While scrolling through some threads on Reddit, I became curious about Claude and decided to try it. After a few hours of use, I created an Ollama agent inspired by Claude Code (still in alpha phase), based on lightweight local models, ideal for automating small coding tasks.

The system is still rough, but it already includes essential security features to avoid incidents. It's perfect for me: not being a programmer, I can still create simple but useful automation tools for my daily workflow.

Here's a brief example:

## A Personal Reflection

In summary, as an artist I don't particularly appreciate the use of artificial intelligence in creative processes. For many reasons: it tends to diminish their value, reduces the experiential component, and produces results that, in my opinion, often remain underperforming.

However, I recognize that for technical or support activities — such as writing small scripts, automation, or work organization — current tools can be extremely useful. It's in this area that I find a balance between curiosity and utility, without compromising the artistic dimension that for me remains essential.
